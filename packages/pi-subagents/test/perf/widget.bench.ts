/**
 * widget.bench.ts — the always-on above-editor `AgentWidget`.
 *
 * The widget scans the agent list during update and render. Each TUI frame
 * redraws it, including keystrokes in the main session.
 *
 * `render` and `update` are measured apart because they run at different rates
 * (per frame vs. an 80 ms timer plus ~10 call sites in index.ts) and a
 * regression in one says nothing about the other.
 *
 * Cleanup is in `afterAll`, NOT in tinybench's per-task `teardown`: that hook
 * fires between the warmup and sampling phases, and `dispose()` unregisters the
 * widget by calling `setWidget(key, undefined)`. The first version of this file
 * disposed in `teardown` and reported 33 million renders per second — it was
 * measuring an unregistered widget returning an empty array.

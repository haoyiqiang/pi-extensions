 * /wf slash command registration — kept light. The heavy run-path (runner +
 * loader, ~0.9s of module evaluation) lives in `./command-run.js`, dynamically
 * imported only when needed, so registering the command costs nothing at
 * startup. The import promise is memoized in the handler closure: Pi's
 * extension loader runs jiti with `moduleCache: false`, so a bare `import()`
 * here would re-evaluate the entire graph on EVERY `/wf` — a recurring ~0.9s
 * stall. The closure is held by Pi's command registry and survives across
 * invocations; `/reload` re-registers and resets the memo, so edit pickup is
 * preserved. A post-registration pre-warm kicks the same memoized import
 * shortly after startup: jiti evaluation yields between modules (measured
 * max event-loop stall ~0ms at 5ms sampling), so the warm-up causes no
 * perceptible jank and the first real `/wf` finds the graph ready.
 * `parseArgs` stays here (pure, exported for tests).

 * that is exactly a workflow name, is a `preview` (list / details) — a `run`
 * always carries non-empty input.
 *

 * wins when both are present). A `--name` that is neither — one that still
 * sits mid-input once every leading/trailing flag has been peeled — is the
 * user's own prompt text (`/wf fix the --name handling bug`): it stays in
 * the input untouched and `nameFlagIgnored` is set so the command layer can
 * warn. (A tail run like `go --name a --name b` is NOT mid-input: both peel
 * as trailing, the second as a duplicate.)
 * The two caps flags — `--max-jumps <n>` and `--max-laps <n>` — follow the
 * same rule (leading or trailing only, any relative order among the three);
 * a mid-position caps token stays in the input untouched and, unlike
 * `--name`, sets no flag.
 *
 * A flag repeated in a leading/trailing slot (`--max-jumps 6 --max-jumps 9
 * research …`) is consumed, not stranded: the FIRST-TYPED value wins in
 * every slot (each occurrence is ranked by its offset in the line, not by
 * extraction order), every other occurrence is stripped, and the token
 * lands in `duplicateFlags` so the command layer can warn.
 * Leaving the repeat in the residual would make `--max-jumps` the first
 * token — not a workflow name — and bind the whole line (the user's
 * intended workflow included) as prompt text for the DEFAULT workflow.
 *
 * `@<ref>` on the first token is the resume sigil — the first whitespace-
 * delimited token after `@` is the run reference. Leading space after the
 * sigil is tolerated (`@ ref` === `@ref`); trailing tokens are ignored.
